I am a PhD student at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology ([KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en)). I am part of the [Image and Video Understanding Lab (IVUL)](https://ivul.kaust.edu.sa/) advised by [Bernard Ghanem](http://www.bernardghanem.com/). I received my MSc degree in Telecommunication Engineering and my BSc degree in Information Engineering from the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/). Currently, my research focus lies at the intersection between Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, leveraging deep learning to improve current state-of-the-art approaches.
