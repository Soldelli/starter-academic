We have witnessed in the past few years a boom in the E-sports gaming industry with several online competitions, e.g. Fortnite, FIFA, LOL, GTA to name a few. This has opened new doors for unprecedented economic opportunities through online streaming and advertising campaigns. We propose to step up this industry by merging it with modern tools from computer vision and machine learning to provide AI educational competitions with the flavor of "Human vs AI" that is currently picking up with AlphaZero and AlphaStar by Google DeepMind. Moreover, and since "data is the new oil", we will be utilizing the generated data from the competitions to build better AI agents for future games and challenges. We believe that this will open new advertising opportunities and a new market for data collection that will be provided to the world by NEOM.
